The purpose of this template is to Integrate a Vertex AI Agent with a Flutter app.
1. Create a search data store and search app using Vertex AI Agent Builder in the Google Cloud console.

2. Deploy a Reasoning Engine agent using Vertex AI Workbench.

3. Use a Python app that integrates with Vertex AI Search and Reasoning Engine agent.

4. Deploy the app to Cloud Run and use it as the backend for a Flutter app.

5. Set up a Firebase project and connect it to the Flutter app.

GCP Usage:  Flutter is used as the client app framework, Vertex AI Search is used as a vector DB, and Reasoning Engine is used to build and deploy an agent with LangChain on Vertex AI. The agent uses Gemini, (LLMs) to generate AI responses to text and image prompts.
